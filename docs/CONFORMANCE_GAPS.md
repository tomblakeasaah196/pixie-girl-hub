# V2.2 Conformance Gaps

**Last verified:** 2026-06-08 (see `VERIFICATION_REPORT.md`).

> **Status change.** The original Bucket A/B/C gaps in this file were all
> **shipped to migrations** (see `migrations/CHANGELOG.md`). The schema is
> now essentially fully V2.2-conformant. The live gap class is no longer
> _schema_ gaps — it is **application-layer wiring lag**: schema (and often
> routes) are in place, but the service logic that uses them is incomplete.
> This file now tracks that queue.

## Part 1 — Original gap buckets: SHIPPED ✅

Per `migrations/CHANGELOG.md`, all of the following landed:

| Bucket               | Items                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Where                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| A (cheap mismatches) | A-1 loyalty thresholds, A-2 stylist tiers, A-3 KPI sum-to-100 CHECK, A-4 POS idempotency key, A-5 wishlist, A-6 strive→opay, A-7 payment-fee accounts (9-way split), A-8 cancellation defaults verified                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | `template/000020/000034/000035`, `000008/000010/000015` |
| B (missing features) | B-1 Cash Request (6.32), B-2 installment `payment_model`, B-3 Streak Stars, B-4 Hair Quiz, B-5 UGC + self-hosted video, B-6 Public Order Form, B-7 storefront analytics, B-8 Curated Delivery Letter + Install Hub, B-9 per-gateway fees, B-10 full e-signature                                                                                                                                                                                   | `000100/000101`, `template/000016/000019/000036/000037` |
| C (architecture)     | C-1 RLS **policies** (Option A, full) shipped to `000200`; **app-layer GUC wiring was missing → RLS was inert until R-1 (2026-06-11)** — now wired for write/transaction paths, read-side one-shot enforcement is the remaining step (see `HUB_VS_PIXIE_DEEP_VERIFICATION.md` + `ENTITY_ISOLATION.md`). C-2 field-level privacy (restricted views), C-3 soft-FK reconciliation **(schema only — no sweep yet)**, C-4 strive-connect drift removed | `000200/000202`, `template/000038`                      |

**Schema is therefore conformant.** What remains is to _use_ it.

## Part 2 — Live queue: application-layer wiring lag

These have schema (and sometimes routes) but incomplete service logic.
Ordered roughly by leverage / dependency.

### P1 — Finance correctness — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-08

All six built in one pass (app layer; schema was already in place). New
migration: `000111_shared_cash_request_threshold` (CEO threshold column).

### P2 — Customer-facing revenue surfaces — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-08

Retention, storefront, studio and the install hub are now functional app
layers over the existing schema.

### P3 — Admin / structural — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-08

Preceded by a brand-registry refactor: the hardcoded `new Set(["pixiegirl",
"faitlynhair"])` copied into ~47 files is replaced by `src/config/brands.js`
(single live Set loaded from `business_config`, regex-guarded), so a new
brand goes live without code edits. New migrations: `000112` (email-signature
template column).

| ID   | Item                                 | State   | What landed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---- | ------------------------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| W-11 | **"Add a new business" flow** (6.21) | ✅ done | `GET/POST /api/v1/business-setup/businesses` — `business-provision.service` validates the key, creates the schema, seeds `business_config`, applies every template, verifies table count, and `registerBrand()`s it live. Rolls back a half-built brand on failure. |
| W-12 | **Email-signature builder** (6.13)   | ✅ done | One brand template (`business_config.email_signature_template`, migration 000112) + per-staff render into `shared.email_signatures`. Endpoints under business-setup: GET/PUT template, list/get/PUT-generate per user (token merge, HTML-escaped).                  |
| W-13 | **Catalogue UGC video wiring** (6.4) | ✅ done | `GET /catalogue/products/:id/video-library` (ready `media_assets` videos) + `POST /products/:id/videos/from-media` attaches a self-hosted asset as a `direct_upload` product video (external_ref = asset_id, embed_url = storage_path). No schema change.           |

## Part 3 — Doc hygiene (cheap, do alongside)

- `SCHEMA.md` + `README.md` still say **35 migrations / 425 tables**.
  Actual is **51 migration files** (28 shared + 23 templates) after the gap
  buckets shipped. Re-run `npm run db:verify` and update the counts.

---

## Suggested order of attack

1. ~~**P1 finance (W-1…W-6)**~~ — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-08 (see table above).
2. ~~**P2 customer-facing (W-7…W-10)**~~ — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-08 (see table above).
3. ~~**P3 admin (W-11…W-13)**~~ — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-08 (see table above),
   preceded by the brand-registry refactor (`src/config/brands.js`).

**The W-1…W-13 wiring-lag queue is now fully cleared.** Brand-registry boot
wiring is also done: `refreshBrands()` runs at server startup (after
`initDatabase`) and at worker start, plus a 5-minute `brand-registry-refresh`
cron so a business provisioned by the API process reaches the worker's crons
without a restart.

**Media pipeline shipped 2026-06-08:** the `media-processing` BullMQ worker
now does real FFmpeg work — probe + transcode (H.264/AAC, ≤720p, faststart)

- poster/thumbnail — moving `media_assets` from `pending` → `ready`
  (`media.ffmpeg.js`, `media.repo.js`, `media-processor.js`). `media.service`
  (producer) registers uploads (`POST /catalogue/media`) and remote buffers and
  enqueues them; a `ugc-ingestion` cron drains `ugc_ingestion_queue` (direct_url
  downloads → asset → enqueue → `ready_for_moderation`; platform sources flagged
  for the social-API connector). The W-13 video-library reads the resulting
  `ready` assets.

Remaining follow-ups are operational only: the social-platform UGC connector
(Instagram/TikTok capture) and the doc-hygiene counts below.

## Part 4 — Known pricing inconsistencies (post-launch, deferred)

### G-1 — Bundle campaign price is floor-clamped at checkout but NOT in the cart quote

**Severity:** medium · **Scope:** fixed-price bundles only · **Status:** open
(deferred 2026-06-24 — does not affect the current live campaign, which uses
styled items + the position-ladder "Multi-wig discount").

**Symptom.** For a bundle that has a fixed `campaign_bundle_price_ngn`, the
cart drawer / checkout-form total (the server `/quote`) can show a *lower*
total than the order actually charges. The buyer is then charged **more** than
the figure on the "Pay" button.

**Root cause.** The two paths represent the bundle campaign price differently:

- **Quote** (`campaigns.public.service.js` → `priceQuoteLine`, ~line 691):
  the bundle line's `unit_price_ngn` IS the campaign price and carries
  `floor_ngn: null` — the saving is baked into the unit price and is **never**
  margin-floor clamped.
- **Checkout** (`checkout` → `resolveBundleForCheckout`, ~line 604/941/1126):
  the bundle is priced at **sum-of-parts** and the campaign-price saving is
  added as an order-level `campaign_deal_discount_ngn`, which
  `salesService.createOrder` then **clamps** against each base variant's
  `min_price_ngn` (`sales.service.js` `applyOrderDiscount`).

If a styled bundle's base-variant floors are high relative to its campaign
price, `createOrder` clamps the discount down and the order total exceeds the
quote. The same asymmetry affects the deal **ladder**: `checkout` hands
`deal.gross_discount_ngn` (pre-clamp) to `createOrder`, which re-clamps against
order-line floors that the quote did not use for bundle lines.

**Fix direction (when picked up).** Make the `/quote` path apply the *same*
margin-floor clamp `createOrder` uses (resolve each bundle line's base-variant
`min_price_ngn` and clamp there), so drawer = form = charge in all cases. Add a
test that drives `quoteCart` and `createOrder` on the same fixed-price-bundle
cart and asserts the final totals are equal — no test currently pins that
agreement (`campaigns.bundle-pricing.test.js` checks the pure math only;
`checkout-styled-bundle.test.js` never compares order total to the quote).

**Verified safe meanwhile:** non-bundle campaigns (styled/raw wigs + position
ladder, quantity tier, reseller/bulk) clamp against the *same* base-variant
floors in both paths, so the displayed total already equals the charge — which
is why the current live sale is unaffected.
